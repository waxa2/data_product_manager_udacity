Pharrell Campos,22,Influencer,1X a week,Sponsors often pay for me to use their vehicles or set up transportation for me when visiting their restaurants or events.,It is super cool to arrive to an art gallery opening or restaurant in a flying car. Everyone always stares. Plus no boring time spent in traffic!,"Like I said, I'm always going to new places and openings. Galleries, restaurants, clubs, I think I once took Flyber to an 80s themed workout class!"
Keelan Flores,39,Real Estate,3+ times a week,"If the timing isn't different, I'll take a taxi or uber to save money. ","I'm in real estate, so I have showings all over the city. You can imagine I need to travel a lot and traffic can be killer. Flyber allows me to quickly go from location to location without worrying about what time of day it is.","To check out a new property, or show a property. With clients on a very tight schedule looking at some of the best real estate in NY, I'll even call a Flyber to bring us between different properties in my portfolio during one session."
Kayleigh Mcintosh,42,Plastic Surgeon,1X a month,"Before I started using Flyber, I would use a normal uber.",I like the ability to get home quickly after a long day of surgery. ,Usually I take flyber as a treat when I'm exhausted and want to get home faster after an especially long day at the hospital.

With this real estate market you need to act fast!,"Generally if a showing runs late, I will pull out my phone and open up the app and call a Flyber. I prefer to use text-to-speech which I can't do with Flyber so it can be a little annoying when I'm already in a hurry."
Sapphire Dupont,60,Surgeon,2X a month,"Before Flyber, I'd call a taxi service on the phone.","I volunteer as a pro-bono surgeon a couple times a months.

Louis Jones,70,Oil Magnate,"5+ times a month, during the 6 months/year I'm in NYC","I have a personal car service on call. My assistant books Flyber whenever I'd be travelling during peak NYC traffic hours. Time is money and Flyber saves me time! But I let my assistant actually book the Flyber because the first few times I tried booking, the instructions were too small.",Flyber gives me the convenience I already have travelling between cities and gives it to me within the city.,Generally between business meetings in the city
Robbie Gates,67,"VP, Fortune 50",Tried it once,"Honestly, I thought about using Flyber to suprise my grandson or granddaughter with a visit to one of their sporting games. Luckily my daughter was around to help me book the ride. I usually just use Uber because it remembers my addresses and has all my favorite places saved, so I guess I always just open that up since it is so convenient and saves me time. Though now that I say that, I really should use Flyber again since it would save more time when it comes to fighting traffic!","It would be great to use Flyber to go from the office to visit with my grandchildren at school, like I do with Uber. Since it saves time over a car ride, it might allow me to visit more often","The one time I used Flyber, I was going to my grandson's school to watch him pitch in a baseball game."
Esmae Wagner,65,CEO,Every couple months,"I usually use Flyber when I need to get from the office to a client meeting. Before Flyber, we used a car service.

Charlie Johnson,75,Retired,I've used in a few times.,"I call up our local pilot, Bob. He's not always available but I don't need to fiddle around with an app and hitting tiny buttons. He knows where I tend to be and where I want to go.","Like I said, Bob isn't always available. Flyber has lots of different pilots so I don't need to worry if my dinner runs late that I might be keeping Bob waiting.","My wife and I love to visit friends all over NYC and try out new restaurants. But, at the end of a great day of socializing, I want to get home quickly, not sit in NYC traffic."
